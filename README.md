In a group of 8, we created a fully functional restaurant website/kiosk.
This was a semester long project. A fully functional backend and front end.
We had requirements such as documentation, a cart and menu system, enbedded games,
payment/coupon system, top items featured, and a rewards system.
This was coded in PHP, JSON, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.
